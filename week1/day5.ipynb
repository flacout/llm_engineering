      "I’m currently working with two incredible founders in early-stage startups, helping them find the tech talent that will drive their visions forward. Lately, I’ve been connecting with some truly brilliant Machine Learning Engineers to support these companies (particularly those focused on GPU/LLM inference projects).\n",

      "When a company invests in innovation, the stakes are high. Hiring the wrong person can be costly, but partnering with the wrong recruiter can be just as damaging. Your energy, money, and reputation are on the line when you choose a recruiting partner.\n",

      "I’m eager to connect with more founders who understand that at this critical stage, every hire is vital. If you’re not just looking for resumes but for the right talent that fits your vision, let’s connect.\n",

      "Re: LLMs, one of the big issues these days is there is so much research being spewed out as if it has *any* commercial applications. For the unwashed masses trying to build a business, it's important to remember many \"releases\" are simply repackaged PhD theses.   #openai #llms #genai #gpt4\n",

      "CEO Alexandr Wang made waves with his announcement a couple of weeks ago about adopting an #MEI approach at Scale AI. Whether or not you agree with him on this, what rings clear is an unflinching commitment to hiring the best talent possible and some of the strategies used to accomplish this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I use him as an example because even though I am a recruiting and hiring expert, I learn a lot from those out in the trenches building their companies and he has obviously done so with great success! \n",
      "\n",
      "One of the strategies mentioned by Alexandr is \"casting a wide net\" in recruiting. I have become a firm believer in this strategy and it is one that we employ on behalf of clients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are just some of the reasons to cast a wide net in hiring:\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ Casting a wide net is more likely to attract candidates with diverse thinking styles, problem-solving approaches, and experiences. This type of cognitive and experiential diversity can lead to increased innovation and creativity and can help your organization be more resilient to future changes in the industry or economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ A wider search can uncover candidates with unique skill combinations or non-traditional backgrounds who might be overlooked in a narrow search. These \"hidden gems\" can bring fresh perspectives and innovative solutions to your organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ A larger candidate pool increases the chances of finding individuals who are not just qualified, but are an excellent fit for both the role and the company culture. This can lead to better performance and reduced turnover.\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ Engaging with a wider range of candidates increases your company's visibility in the job market and naturally expands your company's network. This can also lead to valuable market insights, potential partnerships, or customer connections that extend beyond the hiring process itself. Even candidates who aren't hired can become brand ambassadors if they have a positive experience, potentially leading to future hires. \n",
      "\n",
      "These are many of the reasons we cast a wide net on behalf of clients. Mainly we want them to have the assurance that they are hiring the best candidate possible and not having to settle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with all the benefits, I recognize that casting a wide net makes recruiting more labor intensive and time consuming. It also requires a more systematic approach to candidate management and may require advanced skills in assessing candidate fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether for an executive or mid-level hire, we can handle the tedious, time consuming aspects.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to our full service model, we offer alternative solutions for non-executive level recruiting and hiring. I'd be glad to hear your needs and discuss ways that we can be of support. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm also always willing to offer advice or ideas that you can employ on your own. A rising tide lifts all boats.\n",

      "This is a good article on using LLMs in the real world. It covers many aspects that we learned at Nurish over the last few months and more. Using LLMs is an inexact science, but has its own needs in processes and tools. While most of the attention has been on the LLMS, their capabilities, and RAG, there are mundane issues that need to be taken care of, issues where the solutions for pre-LLM development are not that well-suited. These include version management, integration, testing, data management, quality assessment, and more. This article covers many of those practical aspects. \n",
